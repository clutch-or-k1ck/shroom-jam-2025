improvements to make game plot possible:
- create the bombs patterning
- create the tunnel at the end

write the game plot

bug: damage animation is drawn on top of other animations - that is wrong
bug: it seems policmen can even spawn right after the barrel in which case it is impossible to win...
bug: duck collision box is too unforgiving. maybe barrels need fixing, too...
bug: proportions are going crazy
bug: probably need to relax hitboxes of literally everyone because the difficulty is crazy rn



chase scene is instantiated dynamically in the tv overlay, not statically attached
