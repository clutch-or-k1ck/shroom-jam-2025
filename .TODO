chase scene is instantiated dynamically in the tv overlay, not statically attached

chase_scene game loop etc:
	- end game sequence
		- stop rolling the world
		- fall down and play death anim
		- alternative death shader? bw? camera zoom? only as potential improvements
		- emit a signal about the game results
	- game plot - a script that adjusts parameters of treadmills, world speed etc.
	- death_stops_game - a bool for debugging purposes
	- game_loop_time_scale - to speed up the entire game loop

a couple more shaders

random items are spawned more frequently than every second (every second makes items follow at an interval) - maybe decrease timer interval or do per-frame
