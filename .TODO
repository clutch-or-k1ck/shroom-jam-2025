base_scene game loop etc:
	- end game sequence
		- stop rolling the world
		- fall down and play death anim
		- alternative death shader? bw? camera zoom? only as potential improvements
		- emit a signal with the game session result
	- death_stops_game - a bool for debugging purposes
	
improvements to make game plot possible:
- check that treadmills can accept and throw away new scenes to spawn
- create a building and a large building
- create the trash box
- puddles and uncontrollabel dash mechanics
write the game plot

chase scene is instantiated dynamically in the tv overlay, not statically attached

a couple more shaders
